Employee Performance Prediction 💻

👈Select a page in the sidebar

This application performs machine learning predictions on Employee Performance and outputs the predictions.

This application provides:

● A machine learning prediction on Employee Performance.💻

● Data Exploration of the dataset used in training and prediction.📊

● Custom data Visualization and Plots.📈


### Data Exploration

The Process of checking and exploring data for conformity and fit for feature engieering or data preprocessing

#### Analysing Data Columns

●   Show Raw Data
●  Plot selected Columns
●  Show Shape: This is the row and column of the dataset
●  Summary: This is the count, mean, standard deviation, min, max etc...

●  Selected Columns: Count of selected column
●  Missing Data: Checking for missing Data
●  Correlation Plot Analysis: This shows the relationship between the columns

### Data Analysis
Since Education has the highest correlation Matrix
We Analyse Education with Performance Rating


● Column Perfromance: This is the summary of Education column
● EP Barchart: This the bar char of Performance against education
● Edaucation Analyxed Seperately: Th

### Modeling

Train test splitting is performed
Y === the variable you wish to be predicted
X === the variable to be use for prediction, you can select more than one

Select one of the MOdel to be deployed
We have 8 models that were used for analysis

● LR = Logistic Prediction
● SVM = Support Vector Machine
● DT= Decision Tree with Grid Search CV
● RF = Random Forest with Grid Search CV
● NB = Naive Bayes
● KNN = K Nerest Neighnour
● Xgboost = XGBoost
● ANN = Artificial Neural Network
● LSTM_CNN = Long Short Term Covolutional Neural Network
